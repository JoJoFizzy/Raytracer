# Simple Raytracer Made in Rust

An implementation of a simple raytracer in Rust; based on the book The Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck (https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/).
I used this project to learn more about graphics and rust, as a result I prioritized learning rather than making a polished product,
so there may be some things that are non-idiomatic, unoptimized, and even poorly programmed.

Features:
* Geometry and Matrix Transformations
* Lighting
* Phong Reflection
* Camera and Scenes
* Shadows
* Planes, Cubes, Cylinders, Triangles
* Patterns
* Refraction
* Rendering OBJ Files (this is buggy depending on the camera and light location)

## Example Output

### Sphere Reflection
![reflection](output/reflection.png)

### Spheres
![spheres](output/spheres.png)

### OBJ File
![head_look_up](output/head_look_up.png)

### Cylinder
![cylinder](output/cylinder.png)

### Refraction
![refraction](output/refraction.png)

### Low Resolution Cube
